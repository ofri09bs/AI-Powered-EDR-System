**AEGIS** (Advanced Endpoint Guard & Intelligence System) is a comprehensive, Python-based **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** solution. Unlike traditional antiviruses that rely solely on signatures, AEGIS employs a **Hybrid Detection Engine** combining **static rules**, **behavioral analysis**, **honeypots**, and **Artificial Intelligence** (Unsupervised Learning) to detect zero-day threats, **ransomware**, and unauthorized users.

## 🚀 Key Features (Technical Breakdown)

### 🧠 1. AI-Driven Network Threat Detection
* **Algorithm:** Unsupervised Learning using **Isolation Forest**.
* **Functionality:** Analyzes network flow vectors (Port, Bytes Sent/Received, Duration, Country Risk) in real-time.
* **Capability:** Detects **Zero-Day C2 (Command & Control)** channels, beaconing behavior, and slow-rate data exfiltration that bypass traditional signature-based firewalls.
* **Behavioral Rules:** Blocks unauthorized use of system binaries (`powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`) for external connections (Living-off-the-Land attacks).

### 🎣 2. ML-Powered Phishing Guard
* **Algorithm:** Supervised Learning using **Random Forest Classifier**.
* **Feature Engineering:** Extracts lexical features from URLs in the clipboard (Entropy, Length, Special Characters, TLD reputation).
* **Capability:** Predicts the probability of a URL being malicious in milliseconds.
* **Defense:** Detects sophisticated **Typosquatting**, Homograph attacks, and obfuscated phishing links before the user even pastes them.

### 👤 3. User Guard: Behavioral Biometrics Engine
* **Algorithm:** Statistical Z-Score Analysis & Dynamic Profiling.
* **Detection Logic:** Continuously authenticates the user based on unique motor skills:
    * **Keystroke Dynamics:** Measures "Flight Time" (latency between keys) and "Dwell Time".
    * **Mouse Trajectory:** Analyzes velocity, acceleration, and angular movements.
* **Defense:** Instantly detects **Account Takeover (ATO)** and physical intrusion. If the behavioral score drops below the threshold, the system initiates a **Hard Lock**.

### 🔒 4. Ransomware Guard (Canary System)
* **Detection Logic:** Honey-token deployment & File Integrity Monitoring (FIM).
* **Mechanism:** Deploys hidden decoy files ("Canaries") in sensitive directories (`/Desktop`, `/Documents`).
* **Auto-Remediation:** Uses **SHA-256 Hashing** to detect unauthorized encryption. Upon detection, it kills the offending process and **automatically restores** the file from a secure memory buffer, effectively neutralizing the encryption impact.

### 🦠 5. Malware Guard (Heuristic Process Hunter)
* **Detection Logic:** Goes beyond simple signature matching by analyzing the *context* of running processes in real-time.
* **Key Capabilities:**
    * **Process Lineage Analysis:** Detects suspicious parent-child relationships (e.g., `winword.exe` spawning `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe`), blocking **Macro-based malware** and **Fileless attacks**.
    * **Volatile Execution Detection:** Flags unsigned binaries executing from high-risk, ephemeral directories (e.g., `%TEMP%`, `AppData`, `Downloads`) often used by droppers.
    * **Backdoor & RAT Detection:** Monitors active process sockets to identify unauthorized listening ports commonly associated with Remote Access Trojans (e.g., DarkComet, Metasploit).
    * **Signature Verification:** Cross-references file hashes (SHA-256) against a local Threat Intelligence database of known malware families.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher.
* Administrator privileges (Required for process termination and file protection).

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/AEGIS-EDR.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/AEGIS-EDR.git)
cd AEGIS-EDR
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Initialize AI & Biometrics
Before running the main dashboard, train the system to recognize "Normal" behavior:

**Network AI**: Run ```python tools/collect_model_data.py``` for a few minutes while browsing normally, then run ```python tools/train_network_model.py```.

**User Biometrics:** The system will automatically enter Learning Mode for the first 60 seconds upon first launch.

## 🎮 Usage
Run the main dashboard with Admin rights:
```bash
python main.py
```

**The Dashboard**
- Status Indicators: Green (Active) / Red (Disabled).

- Live Logs: View real-time threats and system actions.

- Control Panel: Toggle specific agents on/off dynamically.
